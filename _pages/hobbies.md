## Outside of Academia
### Creative Writing
During my undergraduate degree, I explored a series of different subjects before ultimately deciding on my degree path. The one that I was unable to shake, outside of my science courses, was Creative Writing. This lead to not only one of my declared minors, but a series of projects, published and non, stretching from my undergradute honors thesis on my time in Thailand and elephant conservation to my current science fiction/tech noir project [Hart Beat Podcast](hartbeatpodcast.com). Hart Beat Podcast was conceived in two very different places in the same year. A combination of a character invented in a noir writing class and a setting invented in an immunology lecture. We were successfully Kickstarted in 2020, and can be found almost anywhere you listen to podcasts. 


### Rugby
I started playing rugby during my freshman year of my undergraduate, until then, having been what I would call _minimally sporty_. After playing for my allotted five years on the University team, I continued to coach on and off until 2022, when I co-founded the non-collegiate, adult women's rugby team Cold Front Rugby.
